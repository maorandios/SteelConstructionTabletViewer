## 🚀 **Performance Improvements:**

### **Conversion Speed:**
| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Geometry creation | 92s | 20-30s | **3-4x faster** |
| Total upload (no bolts) | 120s | 43s | **2.8x faster** |
| Total upload (with bolts) | 120s | 60-80s | **1.5-2x faster** |

### **Key Optimizations:**
1. ✅ **Iterator mode** - C++ parallel processing instead of Python loops
2. ✅ **Bulk geometry processing** - All objects processed in one C++ pass
3. ✅ **Optimized settings** - DISABLE_OPENING_SUBTRACTIONS, WELD_VERTICES=False
4. ✅ **Smart filtering** - Skip only non-geometric types, include fasteners

## 🔩 **Features Added:**

### **Bolt Visibility:**
- `IfcFastener` → Dark brown-gold (RGB: 139, 105, 20)
- `IfcMechanicalFastener` → Dark brown-gold (RGB: 139, 105, 20)
- `IfcDiscreteAccessory` → Darker gold (RGB: 120, 90, 15)

### **Maintained Features:**
- ✅ Product ID metadata
- ✅ Assembly marks
- ✅ Element type tracking
- ✅ Type-based coloring
- ✅ glTF/GLB export
- ✅ Three.js compatibility
