# Plate Nesting Tab Improvements - Summary

**Date:** 2026-01-27  
**Changes Made:** Enhanced Plate Nesting functionality with proper workflow

## Overview
The Plate Nesting tab has been completely redesigned to provide a proper workflow for users to select plates, configure stock sizes, and generate optimized nesting plans.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Updates (`web/src/components/PlateNestingTab.tsx`)

#### Added Features:
- **Step 1: Plate Selection Table**
  - Displays all available plates from the IFC model (same table structure as Plates Tab)
  - Checkboxes for individual plate selection
  - Select All / Deselect All functionality
  - Real-time selection counter showing selected plates and total pieces
  - Filter by thickness
  - Free text search across all plate properties
  - Visual feedback with highlighted rows for selected plates
  - Auto-selects all plates by default

- **Step 2: Stock Plate Configuration**
  - Configure available stock plate sizes (1-5 different sizes)
  - Add/remove stock sizes
  - Input width and length for each stock size

- **Step 3: Generate Nesting**
  - Clear action button with visual feedback
  - Shows summary of selected plates and configured stock sizes
  - Loading state with spinner
  - Proper error handling with user-friendly messages

#### Improved UI/UX:
- Three-step workflow clearly labeled
- Summary cards showing selection status
- Color-coded sections for better visual hierarchy
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Hover effects and smooth transitions

### 2. Backend Updates (`api/main.py`)

#### Fixed Issues:
- Added support for `selected_plates` parameter from frontend
- Uses frontend-selected plates instead of always extracting from IFC
- Fallback to IFC extraction if no plates are selected
- Added proper logging with `nesting_log()` for debugging
- Better error handling and informative error messages
- URL decoding for filenames with special characters

#### Added Dependencies:
- Installed `rectpack` library for rectangle packing algorithm
- Updated `requirements.txt` with all necessary dependencies:
  - fastapi
  - uvicorn[standard]
  - python-multipart
  - ifcopenshell
  - numpy
  - trimesh
  - pygltflib
  - rectpack

### 3. Server Restart
- Backend server restarted to load rectpack library
- Frontend server restarted to load updated PlateNestingTab component
- Both servers running on:
  - Backend: http://localhost:8000
  - Frontend: http://localhost:5180

## Workflow for Users

1. **Upload IFC File**: User uploads their IFC model
2. **Navigate to Plate Nesting Tab**: Go to the "Plate Nesting" tab
3. **Select Plates**: 
   - Review all available plates in the table
   - Use filters to narrow down plates by thickness or search
   - Select/deselect individual plates or use "Select All"
   - See real-time count of selected plates
4. **Configure Stock Plates**:
   - Review default stock sizes or add custom ones
   - Configure up to 5 different stock plate sizes
   - Enter width × length for each stock size in mm
5. **Generate Nesting**:
   - Click "Generate Nesting Plan" button
   - Wait for algorithm to optimize plate placement
   - Review results with statistics, BOM, and visual cutting plans
   - Export to PDF if needed

## Technical Details

### Data Flow:
1. Frontend fetches plate data from `/api/dashboard-details/{filename}`
2. User selects plates via checkboxes
3. Frontend sends selected plates + stock sizes to `/api/generate-plate-nesting/{filename}`
4. Backend runs rectpack algorithm to optimize placement
5. Backend returns cutting plans, statistics, and BOM
6. Frontend displays visual cutting plans with SVG rendering

### Nesting Algorithm:
- Uses `rectpack` library with `MaxRectsBssf` algorithm
- Supports multiple stock sizes
- Calculates optimal placement to maximize utilization
- Tracks nested and unnested plates
- Provides detailed statistics on material usage and waste

## Files Modified:
- `web/src/components/PlateNestingTab.tsx` - Complete redesign with 3-step workflow
- `api/main.py` - Updated nesting endpoint to handle selected plates
- `api/requirements.txt` - Added rectpack and other dependencies

## Testing Recommendations:
1. Test with various plate selections (all, some, filtered)
2. Test with different stock plate configurations
3. Verify nesting results are visually correct
4. Test PDF export functionality
5. Verify error handling with invalid inputs
6. Test with different IFC files

## Known Issues Resolved:
- ✅ Missing rectpack library causing 500 errors
- ✅ No plate selection interface
- ✅ Unable to choose which plates to nest
- ✅ No clear workflow steps
- ✅ Backend not handling selected plates parameter

## Future Enhancements (Optional):
- Add rotation support for plates in nesting
- Allow manual adjustment of plate placement
- Save/load stock plate configurations
- Export cutting plans in different formats (DXF, SVG)
- Add material cost calculations
- Support for multiple material types/thicknesses per stock
