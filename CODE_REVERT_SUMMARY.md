# Code Revert Summary - Plate Geometry Display Fix

## Date: 2026-01-28

## Problem
The geometry display for plates was broken after attempting to add bolt hole detection functionality. The code became too complex and introduced bugs that prevented proper geometry visualization.

## Solution
Reverted all modified files to their last working state (commit: a8f2b89) where geometry was displaying perfectly.

## Files Reverted
1. `api/plate_geometry_extractor.py` - Reverted bolt hole detection code
2. `api/main.py` - Reverted API endpoint changes
3. `web/src/components/Dashboard.tsx` - Reverted frontend changes
4. `web/src/components/PlateNestingTab.tsx` - Reverted frontend changes

## What Was Removed
The attempted changes included:
- Complex `project_to_surface_plane()` function with face-based projection
- `detect_bolt_holes()` function trying to find bolt holes from fasteners
- `add_bolt_holes_to_plate()` function for bolt hole integration
- `alpha_shape()` algorithm for concave hull detection
- Multiple fallback strategies that added complexity

All this code was attempting to:
1. Project 3D mesh faces to 2D using surface analysis
2. Detect bolt holes by analyzing fastener positions
3. Create holes in plate geometry by merging triangular faces

## Current Working State
The code is now back to the simple, working version that:
- Uses PCA-based projection for 2D geometry
- Creates clean convex hull polygons
- Displays accurate plate shapes
- Works reliably without complex bolt hole detection

## Server Status
- Backend: Running on http://localhost:8000
- Frontend: Running on http://localhost:5180
- Both servers restarted with reverted code
- All endpoints operational

## Next Steps
If bolt hole detection is needed in the future, it should be:
1. Implemented as a separate, optional feature
2. Not integrated into the core geometry extraction
3. Thoroughly tested before deployment
4. Kept simple with clear fallbacks

## Verification
The geometry extraction now works as it did in commit a8f2b89:
- Plates display with correct 2D shapes
- Nesting visualization works properly
- No complex algorithms causing failures
- Fast and reliable geometry extraction

## Git Status
All changes have been reverted to last commit. Documentation files remain untracked:
- BOLT_HOLES_FROM_FASTENERS.md
- GEOMETRY_NESTING_*.md  
- PLATE_*.md
- etc.

These are documentation only and don't affect the code.
